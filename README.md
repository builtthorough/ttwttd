This is a Php/MySQL web application that helps to you learn new skills and/or achieve goals. It reminds you of lessons learned as well as those that did not help. "The dullest pencil is better than the sharpest memory." - Mark Twain

I learned through PHP documentation, resources and tutorials that, through Object Oriented Programming ("OOP") concepts, you can create a PHP Data Object ("PDO") out of a MySQL database and then manipulate the PDO's data and functions to create a type of "To-Do" list. I adapated that to create this more unique type of list, the "TTWTTD" tool. I believe in thorough commenting and you will find that in the project.

I developed this project with Netbeans IDE and downloaded MAMP to run the Apache server on my machine so I could develop locally.
